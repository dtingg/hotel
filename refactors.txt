Dear Future Dianna:

Double check all of your classes and see if you can reduce dependency among them.

The BookingManager class does a lot of work.  Can any of that be moved to another class?

Maybe add more fields to the reservation class like guest name, address, phone number, email?

Maybe add some custom errors.  For example, when someone tries to create a block when there is already a block with that name.

You should probably do some more testing/error handling on main.rb.  
It works if you use it normally, but there could be some weird edge cases that haven't been accounted for.

Do you want to go back and create another class called DateRange?  
It could represent the check-in and check-out dates and have methods like number of nights and overlap?
